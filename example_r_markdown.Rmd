# Introduction

This is a markdown area.

That top part with blue `---` is the YAML part of a .rmd document. It tells it how to be rendered. In this case the output is a `html_document`.

**This** text is markdown. It is a basic way to write text and do *simple* styling.

The part below (signified by ```{r} <some code> ```is a code chunk. Write R there and run with CMD/Ctrl + SHIFT + ENTER.

```{r}
#I'm a CODE CHUNK. Write code here!
print("Hey")
```

If you click the `Knit` button up top it will render this into an `html_document`.
